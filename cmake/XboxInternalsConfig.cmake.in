# XboxInternals CMake Package Configuration File
# 
# This file allows downstream projects to use find_package(XboxInternals) to locate
# and link against the XboxInternals library.
#
# Usage in downstream CMakeLists.txt:
#   find_package(XboxInternals REQUIRED)
#   target_link_libraries(YourTarget PRIVATE XboxInternals::XboxInternals)
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Qt6 (Core, Xml) - Required at runtime
#   - Botan - Embedded in XboxInternals (no separate installation needed)
#   - C++20 compiler

# Find required Qt6 components
# Note: Qt6 must be available in the consumer's environment
include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
find_dependency(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Xml)

# Include the exported targets file
# This defines XboxInternals::XboxInternals and XboxInternals::BotanAmalgamation
include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/XboxInternalsTargets.cmake")

# Verify the targets were created
if(NOT TARGET XboxInternals::XboxInternals)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "XboxInternals::XboxInternals target not found!")
endif()

# Optional: Check for static variant if it was built
if(TARGET XboxInternals::XboxInternalsStatic)
    set(XboxInternals_STATIC_FOUND TRUE)
else()
    set(XboxInternals_STATIC_FOUND FALSE)
endif()

# Set XboxInternals_FOUND to TRUE (handled by find_package)
