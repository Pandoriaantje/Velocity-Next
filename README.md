Velocity-Next
=============

**Velocity-Next is a continuation of the original [Velocity](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity) project, which ceased active development some time ago. This fork aims to modernize the codebase, add new features, and maintain compatibility with current operating systems and toolchains.**

### What's New in Velocity-Next

- **Smart Pointer Refactoring**: Modern C++20 memory management for improved stability
- **ISO/XEX Integration**: Merged improvements from Gualdimar/Velocity fork
- **MSVC 2022 Support**: Full compatibility with Visual Studio 2022 alongside MinGW
- **Modernized Build System**: CMake 3.20+ with modern target-based patterns
- **Standalone XboxInternals Library**: Can now be distributed and used independently
- **Active Development**: Issues and PRs are welcomed and will be addressed

### Credits

Original Velocity was developed mainly by Stevie Hetelekides (Hetelek) and Adam Spindler (Experiment5X), with contributions from [many others](https://github.com/hetelek/Velocity/graphs/contributors). Velocity-Next continues their work with gratitude and respect for the foundation they built.

## Important: Administrator Privileges Required (Windows)

On **Windows**, Velocity requires **Administrator privileges** to access Xbox 360 drives:

## Running Velocity-Next

- **Right-click** `VelocityNext.exe` → Select **"Run as administrator"**
- This is necessary for detecting and browsing Xbox 360 hard drives and USB devices
- Without Administrator rights, drives will **not be detected** in the Device Viewer

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#running-velocity) for Linux/macOS requirements and more details.
